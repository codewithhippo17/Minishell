# Minishell

A compact, modular, POSIX-like command-line shell implemented in C. This repository contains a custom shell project that implements tokenization, parsing, expansion, execution, builtins and inter-process communication (pipes/redirections), with support for heredoc and signal handling.

This README summarizes the repository, highlights its strengths, describes how to build and run the project, and gives usage and contribution guidance.

---

## Highlights & Strengths

- Modular code layout: the source is organized into focused directories (lexer, parser/ast, expander, executor, builtins, heredoc, signals, pipex, etc.), which makes the project easy to navigate, reason about, and extend.
- Readline integration: the shell uses GNU Readline for interactive input (history and line-editing features).
- Full command pipeline support: separate pipex/executor components indicate support for multi-process pipelines.
- Redirections and heredoc support: dedicated heredoc and redirection handling are present.
- Built-ins separation: builtins are implemented in a dedicated folder, keeping builtin logic isolated from the executor.
- Included libft: a bundled `libft` indicates a set of reusable helpers and utilities reduces external dependencies.
- Build automation: a Makefile is provided for compiling the project and common targets.
- Active commit history: frequent commits and incremental improvements indicate active development.

## Repository Structure (top-level)

- Makefile
- minishell.c
- minishell.h
- .gitignore
- ast/            — AST/parsing related code
- builtins/       — builtin command implementations (cd, echo, pwd, export, unset, env, exit, etc.)
- checker/        — syntax/semantic checking utilities
- exec_builtin/   — interfaces to execute builtins
- executor/       — process execution, command launching
- expander/       — variable and wildcard expansion
- gb_col/         — helpers / collections
- heredoc/        — here-document implementation
- includes/       — header files used across modules
- kill/           — signal/termination helpers
- lexer/          — tokenization and lexical analysis
- libft/          — bundled libft utility library
- pipex/          — pipeline handling and orchestration
- signals/        — signal handling logic
- utils/          — assorted utilities and helpers

(Each folder contains the relevant implementation files and headers to realize the shell functionality.)

## Requirements

- Unix-like environment (Linux / macOS)
- C compiler (gcc / clang)
- GNU Readline development headers/libraries installed (for readline/history)
- Make

On Debian/Ubuntu you can install the readline development package with:
```sh
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev
```

---

## Build

From the repository root:

```sh
make
```

This will compile the project using the provided Makefile. Typical targets in this Makefile include building the executable (`minishell`) and cleaning object files (`make clean`, `make fclean`), though consult the Makefile for exact targets and behaviors.

---

## Run

Start the shell:

```sh
./minishell
```

Once started, you can execute standard system commands, use pipelines and redirections, and run built-in commands.

Example usage:

- Run a single command
  ```sh
  ls -la /tmp
  ```

- Pipelines
  ```sh
  cat file.txt | grep hello | wc -l
  ```

- Redirection
  ```sh
  echo "hello" > out.txt
  wc -c < out.txt
  ```

- Heredoc (example)
  ```sh
  cat << EOF
  line 1
  line 2
  EOF
  ```

- Builtins (examples)
  - cd
  - echo
  - pwd
  - export
  - unset
  - env
  - exit

(Exact builtin behavior is implemented in the `builtins/` and `exec_builtin/` directories. See those files for specific semantics and edge cases.)

---

## Testing & Debugging

- Use the shell interactively to test common flows: pipelines, redirections, heredoc, environment variable expansion, and builtin commands.
- For unit or integration tests, examine `checker/` and the source directories for any provided test helpers.
- To debug, compile with debugging symbols (edit the Makefile or add `CFLAGS=-g`) and run under gdb or use valgrind to check for memory issues:
  ```sh
  valgrind --leak-check=full ./minishell
  ```

---

## Contributing

Contribution areas that will add value:

- Improve parsing and error messages
- Extend builtin compatibility and behavior
- Improve robustness (edge cases, signal safety, race conditions)
- Add automated unit/integration tests
- Add CI (GitHub Actions) to run builds and tests automatically
- Add a clear LICENSE file and contribution guidelines

If you plan to contribute:
- Fork the repository
- Create a branch for your feature/fix
- Open a PR with a clear description and test cases

---

## Notes & Suggestions

- If you plan to distribute or collaborate, consider adding a LICENSE file to clarify reuse and contribution terms.
- Document known limitations and differences from a standard POSIX shell to help users and contributors understand expected behavior.
- The project already contains a clean modular layout — maintaining that separation of concerns will make future improvements easier.

---

## Acknowledgements

- Built upon concepts used in educational shell projects and standard Unix shell design.
- Readline is used to provide a polished interactive experience (editing and history).

If you want, I can:
- produce a polished README file ready to commit to the repository (with a suggested license and contributing template),
- or generate specific sections expanded with code references (e.g., where the lexer or executor lives) to make onboarding easier.
